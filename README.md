# ALPHA @S0.0.1-Alpha
 SATAIS is a generative AI created by @antyle_yt 

**All the code is open-source and customisable**

**Don't use this AI illegally(hacking or other)**

## SATAIS's info

* French and English support , English Primary .
* Runnable on Windows Linux and MacOS with Python and maybe Java

# How to use SATAIS (on python ) ?
# Methode 1 (recommended)
* ## Step one  : 
* Download the code (at Release or Source-code) ans dezip it .
* ## Step two  : 
* If you are on PyCharm , open the project and click on "Readme.md"  ; 
* If you are simply on CMD  :
     tap ``cd C:\exact\location\of\the\files\readme.md ``
* ## Step three :
* ### If you are on Pycharm :
* Go to settings --> Project: "name" --> Python interpreter --> the "**+**" button --> Search Numpy and install it and also tensorflow.
* ### If you are on cmd :
* run as administrator 
* Tap : ``pip install numpy``
* Tap : ``pip install tensorflow``
## Step four : 
(verify if a .h5 / .model / .keras exist)
* ### If you are on PyCharm !
* Go to the folder "Just-launch-me(recommanded)"
* (if you want change the model go to "modellist" , copy the file and name and return into "just-launch-me" paste the file here and go to "launchme.py" and change the name from "default-sataismodelv1.h5" to the name of your selected model ).
* launch ``"launchme.py"``																	
* ### If you are on cmd :																	
* tap ``cd C:\exact\location\of\the\files\TrainerandApp\Just-launch-me(recommanded) ``											
* tap ``python launchme.py``
* ## Step five :
* enjoy the AI !

# Methode 2 (Machine learning (creating a model) not recommended
# __⚠️ YOU NEED LOT OF TIMES AND A GOOD COMPUTER (MACHINE LEARNING)__
* ## Step one  : 
* Download the code (at Release or Source-code) ans dezip it .
* ## Step two  : 
* If you are on PyCharm , open the project and click on "Readme.md"  ; 
* If you are simply on CMD  :
     tap ``cd C:\exact\location\of\the\file ``
* ## Step three :

* ### If you are on cmd :
* run as administrator 
* Tap : ``pip install numpy``
* Tap : ``pip install tensorflow``
## Step four : 
* ### If you are on PyCharm !
* (PS : The instruction are also in the folder)
* Go to the folder "trainingmethod(long)"
* (You can change the corpus.)
* launch ``"trainer.py"``																	
* ### If you are on cmd :																	
* tap ``cd C:\exact\location\of\the\files\TrainerandApp\Trainingmethod(long) ``											
* tap ``python trainer.py``
* ## Step five :
* launch app.py
